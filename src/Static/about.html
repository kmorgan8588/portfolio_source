    <h1>About</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.</p>
      <p>
      I've always been interested in the world of science fiction, and we all are fortunate to live in
      a time where inovation is turning fiction into fact. Being on the forefront of technology means being
       constantly challenged to inspect your beliefs, understanding, and knowledge and being able to carry-on,
       not despite these challenges but because of them. And to all of this, I say yes please.
      </p>
      <p>
      The ideal environment for me is one where I'm constantly learning and facing new challenges,
      and I've found programming and Software Engineering to be a perfect match for me. I love diving
      into a problem head first and figuring out what makes things work.
      </p>
      <p>
      In my recent work I have acquired skills in JavaScript (ES6), HTML, CSS,
      React.js (hooks), Node.js, Express.js, Webpack/Babel, MongoDB/Mongoose, MySQL,
      PostgreSQL, Cassandra, Sequelize, Docker, Nginx, and testing experience in Enzyme, Jest, and Mocha/Chai.
      I'm always ready for a new challenge and acquiring new tools to help over come it. </p>

      <p>
        Enough on that though, let's get to the good stuff...my hobbies!  When I'm not coding you'll typically find me
        on the Ultimate field.  I've been an avid frisbee player for the past decade, starting in College, Go Red Scare!
        I even taught the undergraduate PE course at my university my senior year.  Since then I've been mostly playing in
        pickup games and leagues.
      </p>
      <p>Outisde of my athletic interests, I'm a huge fan of tabletop and board games.  If you're looking for the best
        Dungeons and Dragons podcast, check out <a target="_blank" href="https://critrole.com">Critical Role!</a>  I've only been playing DnD for
        a few years now, but I'm totally hooked! <br>
        I've also been playing video games on some form of Xbox since they came out, nearly 19 years ago!!!, and my Switch definitely gets plenty of love.
      </p>
      <p>I moved to Seattle about 2 and half years ago and I recently got engaged to my partner aboard the Millenium Falcon at DisneyWorld *pre-COVID*.
        I'm excited to spend the rest of my life with someone so awesome!
