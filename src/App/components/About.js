        I've always been interested in the world of science fiction, and we all are fortunate to live in
        a time where innovation is turning fiction into fact. Being on the forefront of technology means being
        continually challenged to inspect your beliefs, understanding, and knowledge, and carrying on <strong>because</strong> {' '}
        of the challenges, not despite them. And to that, I say <strong>yes please</strong>.

        The ideal environment for me is one where I'm constantly learning and facing new challenges,
        and I've found programming and software engineering to be a perfect match for me. I love diving
        into a problem head first and figuring out what makes things work.

        When I'm not coding you'll typically find me on the Ultimate field.  I've been an avid frisbee
        player for the past decade, starting in college. Go Red Scare!  I even taught the undergraduate
         PE course at my university my senior year.  Since then I've been mostly playing in pickup games and leagues.

        Outside of my athletic interests, I'm a huge fan of tabletop and board games.  If you're looking for the best

        I've only been playing DnD for a few years now, but I'm totally hooked!  I've also been playing video games
        on some form of Xbox since they released, nearly 19 years ago.  My Switch definitely gets plenty of love as well.

        I moved to Seattle about 2 and half years ago and I recently got engaged to my partner aboard the
        Millennium Falcon at DisneyWorld pre-COVID.  I'm excited to spend the rest of my life with someone so awesome!
