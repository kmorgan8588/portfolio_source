This is a living document, I am adding and making changes currently.

# Phase 1

Build the basic front end structure using plain HTML and CSS
My server handles one POST route for my email API.

# Phase 2

Refactor to React and use react-router to handle correct browser history to follow best practices
Use hooks for email form management.  This isn't much state to track in general so the goal is to keep things clean and seperate my concerns well.

# Phase 3

TBD
